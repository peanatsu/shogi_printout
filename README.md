# Western Shogi Printout-Set

## Intended audience
This is a shogi printout piece-set for beginners
(or otherwise) coming from a non-Japanese background,
and therefore don't have the benefit of years of learning
kanji in school.

It is intended to lower the entry barrier for foreigners
(meaning non-Japanese people) wanting to learn the game
of shogi, by providing variety of kanji-free piece-sets,
as well as a couple of kanji-learning sets.

It is also useful for visually impaired people, since the
symbolic Western sets are much easier to visually parse than
the delicate kanji. Additionally, as a visual as well as a
learning aid, several sets are colored in a consistent (across
sets) color scheme.

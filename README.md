# Western Shogi Printout-Set

## Intended audience
This is a collection of shogi printout piece-sets for
beginners (or otherwise) coming from a non-Japanese background,
who didn't have the benefit of learning kanji in school for years.

It is intended to lower the entry barrier for non-Japanese people
wanting to learn the game of shogi, by providing a variety of
kanji-free piece-sets, as well as a couple of kanji-learning sets.

It is also useful for visually impaired people, since the
symbolic Western sets are much easier to visually parse than
the delicate kanji. Additionally, as a visual as well as a
learning aid, several sets are colored in a consistent (across
sets) color scheme.
